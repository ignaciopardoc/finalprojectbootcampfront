# finalprojectbootcampfront

This is my final project for the Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp. 

This repository is linked to finalprojectbootcampback which you can find it also on my Github repositories!

It is necesary to have installed Node.js globally. 

When you have everything setted up just execute npm install on the folder you have cloned this repository and npm start to start the server.

This includes a register, login system with encrypted data. Includes a map system where business can log in and create their profile to be shown on the map. As well includes another type of user which are dog owners, where they can add information about their dogs, rate the business and check the events the business have created. To make a new event, the business must be premium users. You can put a IBAN number on the payment page (do not worry we do not collect them ;)) and automatically the business will be premium users!

## IMPORTANT

Always remember to execute first the back server first

Enjoy!
